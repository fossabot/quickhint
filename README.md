# quickhint

- The 2nd attempt to provide fast completion for large amount of data
- Implemented in C++14 and (will be ported to python/javascript)
- Most of the logic is inspired by neural networks
- So in case you would like to read the source code, it is a typical network ..
- I hope I can find the time to write some docs
- I am more concentrated on the actual libraries produced not the docs for now ..
